    "Here we will see, which dataset is more biased, or gives more mean squared error with same model. First I need to import libraries I need to check with which dataset my models perform better. To check I will use a technique called cross-validation. I will perform prediction on three machine learning algorithms. And then I import datasets I need. Also we need to shuffle our dataset. So far I made three different datasets. They will be shaffled, in script. Third dataset is mix of first and second dataset. Some values are dropped, some are imputed with another categorical values, and \"Пробег\" column is the only column subjected to predictive imputation, the reason I created the third dataset was in hope to maximally reduce the data."
